  <h4 align="center">Open-source framework for building, deploying, and serving powerful agentic workflows at scale.</h4>
</p>

The Bee Agent Framework makes it easy to build scalable agent-based workflows with your model of choice. The framework is been designed to perform robustly with [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/) and [Llama 3.x](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/) models, and we're actively working on optimizing its performance with other popular LLMs.<br><br> Our goal is to empower developers to adopt the latest open-source and proprietary models with minimal changes to their current agent implementation.

## Key Features

- 🤖 **AI agents**: Use our powerful [Bee agent](/docs/agents.md) refined for Llama 3.1 and Granite 3.0, or [build your own](/docs/agents.md).
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Use our [built-in tools](/docs/tools.md) or [create your own](/docs/tools.md) in Javascript/Python.
- 👩‍💻 **Code interpreter**: Run code safely in a [sandbox container](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter).
- 💾 **Memory**: Multiple [strategies](/docs/memory.md) to optimize token spend.
- ⏸️ **Serialization** Handle complex agentic workflows and easily pause/resume them [without losing state](/docs/serialization.md).
- 🔍 **Instrumentation**: Use [Instrumentation](/docs/instrumentation.md) based on [Emitter](/docs/emitter.md) to have full visibility of your agent’s inner workings.
- 🎛️ **Production-level** control with [caching](/docs/cache.md) and [error handling](/docs/errors.md).
- 🔁 **API**: Integrate your agents using an OpenAI-compatible [Assistants API](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-api) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-python-sdk).
- 🖥️ **Chat UI**: Serve your agent to users in a [delightful UI](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-ui) with built-in transparency, explainability, and user controls.

### Installation

```shell
npm install bee-agent-framework
```

or

```shell
yarn add bee-agent-framework
```

### Example

```ts
import { BeeAgent } from "bee-agent-framework/agents/bee/agent";
import { OllamaChatLLM } from "bee-agent-framework/adapters/ollama/chat";
import { TokenMemory } from "bee-agent-framework/memory/tokenMemory";
import { DuckDuckGoSearchTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/search/duckDuckGoSearch";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";

const llm = new OllamaChatLLM(); // default is llama3.1 (8B), it is recommended to use 70B model

const agent = new BeeAgent({
  llm, // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/adapters'
  memory: new TokenMemory({ llm }), // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/memory'
  tools: [new DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), new OpenMeteoTool()], // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/tools'
});

const response = await agent
  .run({ prompt: "What's the current weather in Las Vegas?" })
  .observe((emitter) => {
    emitter.on("update", async ({ data, update, meta }) => {
      console.log(`Agent (${update.key}) 🤖 : `, update.value);
    });
  });

console.log(`Agent 🤖 : `, response.result.text);
```

➡️ See a more [advanced example](/examples/agents/bee.ts).

➡️ you can run this example after local installation, using the command `yarn start examples/agents/simple.ts`

> [!TIP]
>
> To run this example, be sure that you have installed [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model downloaded.

> [!TIP]
>
> Documentation is available at https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/

### Local Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> `yarn` should be installed via Corepack ([tutorial](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack))

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework`.
2. Install dependencies `yarn install --immutable && yarn prepare`.
3. Create `.env` (from `.env.template`) and fill in missing values (if any).
4. Start the agent `yarn run start:bee` (it runs `/examples/agents/bee.ts` file).

➡️ All examples can be found in the [examples](/examples) directory.

➡️ To run an arbitrary example, use the following command `yarn start examples/agents/bee.ts` (just pass the appropriate path to the desired example).

### 📦 Modules
