# üêù IBM Granite Bee

The [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite) family of models can be used as the underlying LLM within Bee Agents. Granite‚Ñ¢ is IBM's family of open, performant, and trusted AI models tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

This guide and the associated examples will help you get started with creating Bee Agents using Granite 3.1.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

### LLM Services

IBM Granite 3.1 is supported by [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Watsonx.ai will allow you to run models in the cloud. Ollama will allow you to download and run models locally.

> [!TIP]
> Better performance will be achieved by using larger Granite models.

> [!NOTE]
> If you work for IBM there are additional options to run IBM Granite 3.1 models with VLLM or RITS.

#### Ollama

There are guides available for running Granite 3.1 with Ollama on [Linux](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/run/granite-on-linux/granite/), [Mac](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/run/granite-on-mac/granite/) or [Windows](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/run/granite-on-windows/granite/).

#### Watsonx

In order to use IBM [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) you can follow the [IBM watsonx as a Service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas) documentation and in particular their [getting started tutorials](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=getting-started-tutorials).

## üêù Download and install bee-agent-framework

Before getting started you will need to install the bee-agent-framework.

Follow the [Local Installation](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework?tab=readme-ov-file#local-installation) section of our main README to [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the Bee Agent Framework git repository and install its dependencies. Return to this guide when you have completed these steps and are ready to configure environment variables.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Ensure you have access to an IBM Granite model and have followed any other requirements in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above.

The [granite_bee](/examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts) example agent is set up to demonstrate how to use IBM Granite with the Bee Agent Framework. In order to run this example, take the following steps:

1. Copy the [.env.template](/.env.template) file to a new file called `.env` and fill out the required details within the `.env` file (replace the values shown in braces), as follows

   1. For watsonx:

      ```.env
      LLM_BACKEND=watsonx
      WATSONX_API_KEY={YOUR_WATSONX_API_KEY}
      WATSONX_PROJECT_ID={YOUR_WATSONX_PROJECT_ID}
      WATSONX_REGION=us-south
      ```

      Note: [other regions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=integrations-regional-availability-cloud) are also available

   1. For Ollama:

      ```.env
      LLM_BACKEND=ollama
      OLLAMA_HOST={http://0.0.0.0:11434}
      ```

1. Run the [granite_bee](/examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts) agent:

   ```shell
   yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "What is the current weather in London?"
   ```

   This will show the various stages of the agent running (reasoning, tool calling etc.) and ultimately deliver an answer similar to the following:

   > Agent ü§ñ : The current weather in London is 13.3¬∞C with no rain. The maximum temperature for today is expected to be 13.5¬∞C.

   You can try out other prompts as follows:

   ```shell
    yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "Who is the current CEO of IBM?"
    yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "What is the spanish and french word for dog?"
    yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "What does the alias command do in the BASH shell?"
    yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "What‚Äôs the largest technology company by market capitalization right now?"
    yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_bee.ts <<< "What‚Äôs the weather going to be like tomorrow in Sydney?"
   ```

   The example is configured with 2 available [tools](/docs/tools.md), these are OpenMeteo for facilitating weather related prompts and DuckDuckGo for facilitating search related prompts. The above example prompts demonstrate how each of these tools can be exercised.

## ü§ñ Granite Wiki Bee

The [granite_wiki_bee](/examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts) agent is set up to demonstrate more advanced usage of the bee agent framework, specifically performing information retrieval on tool output via the frameworks tool customization options.

This agent uses the [WikipediaTool](/src/tools/search/wikipedia.ts) which enables it to search wikipedia and access articles. However, Wikipedia articles are often quite large which can overfill the LLM's context window and include information that may not be relevant to the task.

In this example the wikipedia tool interface is extended so that the agent can specify both a wikipedia page and a search query within the page. The wikipedia tool output is chunked and piped into a [SimilarityTool](/src/tools/similarity.ts) that calculates the cosine similarity between the query and the data chunks. Only the most relevant chunks are then provided to the agents memory.

This example uses Ollama exclusively.

To get started you will need to pull `granite3.1-dense:8b` and `nomic-embed-text` (to perform text embedding). If you are unfamiliar with using Ollama then check out instructions for getting up and running at the the [Ollama Github repo](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

```shell
ollama pull granite3.1-dense:8b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama serve
```

Run the [granite_wiki_bee](/examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts) agent:

```shell
yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts <<< "Who were the authors of the research paper 'Attention is all you need', how many citations does it have?"
```

You will see the agent reasoning, calling the WikipediaTool and producing a final answer similar to the following:

> Agent ü§ñ : The authors of the paper 'Attention is all you need' are Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. The paper has been cited more than 100,000 times as of 2024.

You can try out other prompts in the following manner:

```shell
yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts <<< "When was the collapse of the Roman Empire?"
yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts <<< "What is the Great Barrier Reef?"
yarn run start examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts <<< "Where is IBM headquartered?"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The peformance of the [granite_wiki_bee](/examples/agents/granite/granite_wiki_bee.ts) is dependent on wikipedia as an information source as well as the retrieval settings included in the example. If you are encountering performance issues with a particular example, try to experiment with the retreival settings i.e. passageSize, overlap and maxResults. You can also try other embedding models via Ollama.
