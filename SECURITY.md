# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities, you can privately report a potential security issue
via the GitHub security vulnerabilities feature. This can be done here:

https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/security/advisories

Please do **not** open a public issue about a potential security vulnerability.

You can find more details on the security vulnerability feature in the GitHub
documentation here:
