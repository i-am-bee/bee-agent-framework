    "\n",
    "The main components of a BeeAI workflow is state, defined as a pydantic model, and steps, which are defined using python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of State as structured memory that the workflow can read and write during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps are the the functional components of the Workflow that connect together to perform the actions of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following simple workflow example exhibits the following key features: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The state definition contains a required message field.\n",
    "- The step (my_first_step) is defined as a function parameterized with the state instance.\n",
    "- The state can be modified in a step and state changes are persisted between steps and workflow executions.\n",
    "- The step function returns a string `Workflow.END` which indicates the name of the next step (this is how step transitions are implemented).\n",
    "- `Workflow.END` indicates the end of the workflow."
