# üîç SearXNG Setup Instructions

## Description

SearXNG is a metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines. SearXNG does not require an API key, you can run SearXNG directly on your laptop to facilitate easy access to web search functionality for your agent.

## Setup

Follow the steps to create a private SearXNG instance. For more advanced usage see the [SearXNG project documentation](https://github.com/searxng/searxng).

### 1. Create a local folder for the SearXNG configuration files

The files will be automatically written to this location, but you will need to make a minor modification.

```shell
 mkdir ~/searxng
```

### 2. Run the SearXNG docker container

```shell
docker run -d --name searxng -p 8888:8080 -v ./searxng:/etc/searxng --restart always searxng/searxng:latest
```

### 3. Edit the configuration files and restart the container

When you first run a SearXNG docker container, it will write configuration files to the `~/searxng` folder.

```shell
settings.yml
uwsgi.ini
```

Open `~/searxng/settings.yml`, find the `formats:` list and add `json`.

```yaml
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

Ensure the settings are globally readable, to avoid issues with mapping userids between the container and the host,

```shell
chmod guo+r searxng/settings.yml
```

Stop and restart the container.

```shell
docker stop searxng
docker run -d --name searxng -p 8888:8080 -v ./searxng:/etc/searxng --restart always searxng/searxng:latest
```

### 4. Check installation

Navigate to `http://localhost:8888` and you should see an SearXNG interface.
