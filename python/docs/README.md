## Why pick BeeAI?

**üèÜ Build the optimal agent architecture for your use case.** To design the right architecture for your use case, you need flexibility in both orchestrating agents and defining their roles and behaviors. With the BeeAI framework, you can implement any multi-agent pattern using Workflows. Start with our out-of-the-box ReActAgent, or easily customize your own agent implementation.

**üöÄ Scale effortlessly with production-grade controls.** Deploying multi-agent systems requires efficient resource management and reliability. With the BeeAI framework, you can optimize token usage through [memory strategies](/python/docs/memory.md), persist and restore agent state via  [(de)serialization](/python/docs/serialization.md), generate [structured outputs](python/examples/backend/structured.ts), and execute generated code in a sandboxed environment. When things go wrong, BeeAI helps you track the full agent workflow through [events](/python/docs/emitter.md), collect [telemetry](/python/docs/instrumentation.md), log diagnostic data, and handle errors with clear, well-defined [exceptions](/python/docs/errors.md).

**üîå Seamlessly integrate with your models and tools.** Get started with any model from Ollama, Groq, OpenAI, watsonx.ai, and [more](/python/docs/backend.md). Leverage tools from LangChain, connect to any server using the Model Context Protocol, or build your own custom tools. BeeAI is designed for extensibility, allowing you to integrate with the systems and capabilities you need.

## Modules

The source directory (`src`) provides numerous modules that one can use.

## Installation

To install the Python library:
```shell
pip install beeai-framework
```

## Quick example

The following example demonstrates how to create and run a simple AI agent using the BeeAI Framework. This agent leverages an LLM to process queries and generate responses.

```py
from beeai import BeeAgent, LLM

agent = BeeAgent(llm=LLM())

agent.run("What is the capital of Massachusetts")
```

> [!TIP]
>
> To run this example, be sure that you have installed [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model downloaded.

To run other examples, use the following command, replacing [example_name] with the desired script:
```bash
python -m examples.beeai.[example_name]
```

## Roadmap

- Python parity with TypeScript
- Standalone docs site
- Integration with watsonx.ai for deployment
- More multi-agent reference architecture implementations using workflows
- More OTTB agent implementations
- Native tool calling with supported LLM providers
