## Why pick BeeAI?

**🏆 Build for your use case.** Implement simple to complex multi-agent patterns using [Workflows](/typescript/docs/workflows.md), start with a [ReActAgent](/typescript/examples/agents/bee.py), or easily [build your own agent architecture](/typescript/docs/agents.md#creating-your-own-agent). There is no one-size-fits-all agent architecture, you need full flexibility in orchestrating agents and defining their roles and behaviors. 

**🔌 Seamlessly integrate with your models and tools.** Get started with any model from [Ollama](/typescript/examples/backend/providers/ollama.py), [Groq](/typescript/examples/backend/providers/groq.ts), [OpenAI](/typescript/examples/backend/providers/openai.ts), [watsonx.ai](/typescript/examples/backend/providers/watsonx.py), and [more](/typescript/docs/backend.md). Leverage tools from [LangChain](/typescript/examples/tools/langchain.ts), connect to any server using the [Model Context Protocol](/typescript/docs/tools.md#using-the-mcptool-class), or build your own [custom tools](/typescript/docs/tools.md#using-the-customtool-typescript-functions). BeeAI is designed to integrate with the systems and capabilities you need.

**🚀 Scale with production-grade controls.** Optimize token usage through [memory strategies](/typescript/docs/memory.md), persist and restore agent state via [(de)serialization](/typescript/docs/serialization.md), generate structured outputs, and execute generated code in a sandboxed environment. When things go wrong, BeeAI tracks the full agent workflow through [events](/typescript/docs/emitter.md), collects [telemetry](/typescript/docs/instrumentation.md), logs diagnostic data, and handles [errors](/typescript/docs/errors.md) with clear, well-defined exceptions. Deploying multi-agent systems requires resource management and reliability.

## Modules

The source directory (`src`) contains the available modules:

## Installation

Install the framework using npm:

```shell
npm install beeai-framework
```

or yarn:

```shell
yarn add beeai-framework
```

## Quick example

The following example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent workflow using the BeeAI Framework:

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { UnconstrainedMemory } from "beeai-framework/memory/unconstrainedMemory";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "beeai-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";
import { WikipediaTool } from "beeai-framework/tools/search/wikipedia";
import { AgentWorkflow } from "beeai-framework/experimental/workflows/agent";
import { Message, Role } from "beeai-framework/llms/primitives/message";
import { GroqChatLLM } from "beeai-framework/adapters/groq/chat";

const workflow = new AgentWorkflow();

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Researcher",
  instructions: "You are a researcher assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new WikipediaTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "WeatherForecaster",
  instructions: "You are a weather assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new OpenMeteoTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
  execution: { maxIterations: 3 },
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Solver",
  instructions:
    "Your task is to provide the most useful final answer based on the assistants' responses which all are relevant. Ignore those where assistant do not know.",
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

const memory = new UnconstrainedMemory();

await memory.add(
  Message.of({
    role: Role.USER,
    text: "What is the capital of France and what is the current weather there?",
    meta: { createdAt: new Date() },
  }),
);

const { result } = await workflow.run(memory.messages).observe((emitter) => {
  emitter.on("success", (data) => {
    console.log(`-> ${data.step}`, data.response?.update?.finalAnswer ?? "-");
  });
});

console.log(`Agent 🤖`, result.finalAnswer);
```
