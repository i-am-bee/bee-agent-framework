  <h4 align="center">Open-source framework for building, deploying, and serving powerful multi-agent workflows at scale.</h4>
</p>

üêù **Bee Agent Framework** is an open-source TypeScript library for building **production-ready multi-agent systems**. Pick from a variety of [üåê LLM providers](/docs/llms.md#providers-adapters), customize the [üìú prompt templates](/docs/templates.md), create [ü§ñ agents](/docs/agents.md), equip agents with pre-made [üõ†Ô∏è tools](/docs/tools.md), and orchestrate [ü§ñü§ùü§ñ multi-agent workflows](/docs/workflows.md)! ü™Ñ

## Latest updates

- üöÄ **2025-01-09**:
  - Introduced [Workflows](/docs/workflows.md), a way of building multi-agent systems.
  - Added support for [Model Context Protocol](https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/#/tools?id=using-the-mcptool-class), featured on the [official page](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#bee-agent-framework).
- üöÄ **2024-12-09**: Added support for [LLaMa 3.3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct).
- üöÄ **2024-11-21**: Added an experimental [Streamlit agent](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/src/agents/experimental/streamlit/agent.ts).

For a full changelog, see the [releases page](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/releases).

## Why pick Bee?

- ‚öîÔ∏è **Battle-tested.** Bee Agent Framework is at the core of [BeeAI](https://iambee.ai), a powerful platform for building chat assistants and custom AI-powered apps. BeeAI is in a closed beta, but already used by hundreds of users. And it's [fully open-source](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-ui) too!
- üöÄ **Production-grade.** In an actual product, you have to reduce token spend through [memory strategies](/docs/memory.md), store and restore the agent state through [(de)serialization](/docs/serialization.md), generate [structured output](/examples/llms/structured.ts), or execute generated code in a [sandboxed environment](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter). Leave all that to Bee and focus on building!
- ü§ó **Built for open-source models.** Pick any LLM you want ‚Äì including small and open-source models. The framework is designed to perform robustly with [Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/) and [Llama 3.x](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). A full agentic workflow can run on your laptop!
- üò¢ **Bee cares about the sad path too.** Real-world applications encounter errors and failures. Bee lets you observe the full agent workflow through [events](/docs/emitter.md), collect [telemetry](/docs/instrumentation.md), [log](/docs/logger.md) diagnostic data, and throws clear and well-defined [exceptions](/docs/errors.md). Bees may be insects, but not bugs!
- üå≥ **A part of something greater.** Bee isn't just a framework, but a full ecosystem. Use [Bee UI](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-ui) to chat with your agents visually. [Bee Observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe) collects and manages telemetry. [Bee Code Interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter) runs generated code safely in a secure sandbox. The Bee ecosystem also integrates with [Model Context Protocol](https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/#/tools?id=using-the-mcptool-class), allowing interoperability with the wider agent ecosystem!

## Quick example

This example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent workflow using Bee Agent Framework:

<!-- embedme examples/workflows/multiAgentsSimple.ts -->

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { UnconstrainedMemory } from "bee-agent-framework/memory/unconstrainedMemory";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";
import { WikipediaTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/search/wikipedia";
import { AgentWorkflow } from "bee-agent-framework/experimental/workflows/agent";
import { BaseMessage, Role } from "bee-agent-framework/llms/primitives/message";
import { GroqChatLLM } from "bee-agent-framework/adapters/groq/chat";

const workflow = new AgentWorkflow();

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Researcher",
  instructions: "You are a researcher assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new WikipediaTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "WeatherForecaster",
  instructions: "You are a weather assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new OpenMeteoTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
  execution: { maxIterations: 3 },
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Solver",
  instructions:
    "Your task is to provide the most useful final answer based on the assistants' responses which all are relevant. Ignore those where assistant do not know.",
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

const memory = new UnconstrainedMemory();

await memory.add(
  BaseMessage.of({
    role: Role.USER,
    text: "What is the capital of France and what is the current weather there?",
    meta: { createdAt: new Date() },
  }),
);

const { result } = await workflow.run(memory.messages).observe((emitter) => {
  emitter.on("success", (data) => {
    console.log(`-> ${data.step}`, data.response?.update?.finalAnswer ?? "-");
  });
});

console.log(`Agent ü§ñ`, result.finalAnswer);
```

### Installation

```shell
npm install bee-agent-framework
```

or

```shell
yarn add bee-agent-framework
```

### Example

```ts
import { BeeAgent } from "bee-agent-framework/agents/bee/agent";
import { OllamaChatLLM } from "bee-agent-framework/adapters/ollama/chat";
import { TokenMemory } from "bee-agent-framework/memory/tokenMemory";
import { DuckDuckGoSearchTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/search/duckDuckGoSearch";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";

const llm = new OllamaChatLLM(); // default is llama3.1 (8B), it is recommended to use 70B model

const agent = new BeeAgent({
  llm, // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/adapters'
  memory: new TokenMemory({ llm }), // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/memory'
  tools: [new DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), new OpenMeteoTool()], // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/tools'
});

const response = await agent
  .run({ prompt: "What's the current weather in Las Vegas?" })
  .observe((emitter) => {
    emitter.on("update", async ({ data, update, meta }) => {
      console.log(`Agent (${update.key}) ü§ñ : `, update.value);
    });
  });

console.log(`Agent ü§ñ : `, response.result.text);
```

‚û°Ô∏è See a more [advanced example](/examples/agents/bee.ts).

‚û°Ô∏è you can run this example after local installation, using the command `yarn start examples/agents/simple.ts`

> [!TIP]
>
> To run this example, be sure that you have installed [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model downloaded.

> [!TIP]
>
> Documentation is available at https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/

### Local Installation

> [!NOTE]
>
> `yarn` should be installed via Corepack ([tutorial](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack))

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework`.
2. Install dependencies `yarn install --immutable && yarn prepare`.
3. Create `.env` (from `.env.template`) and fill in missing values (if any).
4. Start the agent `yarn run start:bee` (it runs `/examples/agents/bee.ts` file).

‚û°Ô∏è All examples can be found in the [examples](/examples) directory.

‚û°Ô∏è To run an arbitrary example, use the following command `yarn start examples/agents/bee.ts` (just pass the appropriate path to the desired example).
