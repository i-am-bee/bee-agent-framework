<h1 align="center">BeeAI Framework</h1>

BeeAI Framework is an open-source library for building **production-ready multi-agent systems**.<br>
The framework is available both as a [Python](/python/docs) and [TypeScript](/typescript/docs) library. 
We are committed to maintaining parity between the two.

## Latest updates

- üöÄ **2025-02-19**: Launched an alpha of the Python library and rebranded to BeeAI Framework. See our [getting started guide](/python/docs).
- üöÄ **2025-02-07**: Introduced [Backend](/typescript/docs/backend.md) module to simplify working with AI services (chat, embedding). See our [migration guide](/typescript/docs/migration_guide.md).
- üß† **2025-01-28**: Added support for [DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120), check out the [Competitive Analysis Workflow example](/typescript/examples/workflows/competitive-analysis)
- üöÄ **2025-01-09**:
  - Introduced [Workflows](/typescript/docs/workflows.md), a way of building multi-agent systems.
  - Added support for [Model Context Protocol](https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/#/tools?id=using-the-mcptool-class), featured on the [official page](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#bee-agent-framework).
- üöÄ **2024-12-09**: Added support for [LLaMa 3.3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct).
- üöÄ **2024-11-21**: Added an experimental [Streamlit agent](typescript/examples/agents/experimental/streamlit.ts).

For a full changelog, see our [releases page](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/releases).

## Why pick BeeAI?

**üèÜ Build the optimal agent architecture for your use case.** To design the right architecture for your use case, you need flexibility in both orchestrating agents and defining their roles and behaviors. With the BeeAI framework, you can implement any multi-agent pattern using [Workflows](/python/docs/workflows.md). Start with our out-of-the-box [ReActAgent](/python/examples/agents/bee.py), or easily [customize your own agent](/python/docs/agents.md#creating-your-own-agent).

**üöÄ Scale effortlessly with production-grade controls.** Deploying multi-agent systems requires efficient resource management and reliability. With the BeeAI framework, you can optimize token usage through [memory strategies](/python/docs/memory.md), persist and restore agent state via  [(de)serialization](/python/docs/serialization.md), generate structured outputs, and execute generated code in a sandboxed environment. When things go wrong, BeeAI helps you track the full agent workflow through [events](/python/docs/emitter.md), collect [telemetry](/python/docs/instrumentation.md), log diagnostic data, and handle errors with clear, well-defined [exceptions](/python/docs/errors.md).

**üîå Seamlessly integrate with your models and tools.** Get started with any model from [Ollama](/python/examples/backend/providers/ollama.py), [watsonx.ai](/python/examples/backend/providers/watsonx.py), and [more](/python/docs/backend.md). Leverage tools from [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/), connect to any server using the [Model Context Protocol](/python/docs/tools.md#using-the-mcptool-class), or build your own [custom tools](/python/docs/tools.md#using-the-customtool-python-functions). BeeAI is designed for extensibility, allowing you to integrate with the systems and capabilities you need.

## Installation

To install the Python library:
```shell
pip install beeai-framework
```

To install the TypeScript library:
```shell
npm install beeai-framework
```

For more guidance and starter examples in your desired language, head to the docs pages for [Python](/python/docs) and [TypeScript](/typescript/docs).

## Quick example

This example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent workflow using BeeAI Framework in Python:

```py
import asyncio
import traceback

from pydantic import ValidationError

from beeai_framework.agents.bee.agent import BeeAgentExecutionConfig
from beeai_framework.backend.chat import ChatModel
from beeai_framework.backend.message import UserMessage
from beeai_framework.memory import UnconstrainedMemory
from beeai_framework.tools.search.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoSearchTool
from beeai_framework.tools.weather.openmeteo import OpenMeteoTool
from beeai_framework.workflows.agent import AgentFactoryInput, AgentWorkflow
from beeai_framework.workflows.workflow import WorkflowError


async def main() -> None:
    llm = await ChatModel.from_name("ollama:granite3.1-dense:8b")

    try:
        workflow = AgentWorkflow(name="Smart assistant")
        workflow.add_agent(
            agent=AgentFactoryInput(
                name="WeatherForecaster",
                instructions="You are a weather assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
                tools=[OpenMeteoTool()],
                llm=llm,
                execution=BeeAgentExecutionConfig(max_iterations=3),
            )
        )
        workflow.add_agent(
            agent=AgentFactoryInput(
                name="Researcher",
                instructions="You are a researcher assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
                tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],
                llm=llm,
            )
        )
        workflow.add_agent(
            agent=AgentFactoryInput(
                name="Solver",
                instructions="""Your task is to provide the most useful final answer based on the assistants'
responses which all are relevant. Ignore those where assistant do not know.""",
                llm=llm,
            )
        )

        prompt = "What is the weather in New York?"
        memory = UnconstrainedMemory()
        await memory.add(UserMessage(content=prompt))
        response = await workflow.run(messages=memory.messages)
        print(f"result: {response.state.final_answer}")

    except WorkflowError:
        traceback.print_exc()
    except ValidationError:
        traceback.print_exc()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running the example

> [!Note]
>

To run projects, use:

```shell
python [project_name].py
```
