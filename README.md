  <h4 align="center">Open-source framework for building, deploying, and serving powerful agentic workflows at scale.</h4>
</p>

The Bee Agent Framework makes it easy to build scalable agent-based workflows with your model of choice. Our default agent, [Bee](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started-with-bee), is designed to perform robustly with [Llama 3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/), and we're actively working on optimizing its performance with other popular LLMs.<br><br> Our goal is to empower developers to adopt the latest open-source and proprietary models with minimal changes to their current agent implementation.

## Key Features

- 🤖 **AI agents**: Use our powerful [Bee agent](./docs/agents.md) or [build your own](./docs/agents.md).
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Use our [built-in tools](./docs/tools.md) or [create your own](./docs/tools.md) in Javascript/Python.
- 👩‍💻 **Code interpreter**: Run code safely in a [sandbox container](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter).
- 💾 **Memory**: Multiple [strategies](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/overview.md#memory) to optimize token spend.
- ⏸️ **Serialization** Handle complex agentic workflows and easily pause/resume them [without losing state](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/overview.md#serializer).
- 🔍 **Traceability**: Get full visibility of your agent’s inner workings, [log](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/overview.md#logger) all running events, and use our MLflow integration (coming soon) to debug performance.
- 🎛️ **Production-level** control with [caching](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/overview.md#cache) and [error handling](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/docs/overview.md#errors).
- 🚧 (Coming soon) **API**: Configure and deploy your agents with a production-hardened API.
- 🚧 (Coming soon) **Chat UI**: Serve your agent to users in a delightful GUI with built-in transparency, explainability, and user controls.

## Get started with Bee

### Installation

```shell
npm install bee-agent-framework
```

or

```shell
yarn add bee-agent-framework
```

### Example

```ts
import { BeeAgent } from "bee-agent-framework/agents/bee/agent";
import { OllamaChatLLM } from "bee-agent-framework/adapters/ollama/chat";
import { TokenMemory } from "bee-agent-framework/memory/tokenMemory";
import { DuckDuckGoSearchTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/search/duckDuckGoSearch";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";

const llm = new OllamaChatLLM(); // default is llama3.1 (8B), it is recommended to use 70B model

const agent = new BeeAgent({
  llm, // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/adapters'
  memory: new TokenMemory({ llm }), // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/memory'
  tools: [new DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), new OpenMeteoTool()], // for more explore 'bee-agent-framework/tools'
});

const response = await agent
  .run({ prompt: "What's the current weather in Las Vegas?" })
  .observe((emitter) => {
    emitter.on("update", async ({ data, update, meta }) => {
      console.log(`Agent (${update.key}) 🤖 : `, update.value);
    });
  });

console.log(`Agent 🤖 : `, response.result.text);
```

To run this example, be sure that you have installed [ollama](https://ollama.com) with the [llama3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) model downloaded.

➡️ See a more [advanced example](./examples/agents/bee.ts).

➡️ All examples can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory.

➡️ To run an arbitrary example, use the following command `yarn start -- examples/agents/bee.ts` (just pass the appropriate path to the desired example).

### Local Installation (Python Interpreter + Interactive CLI)

> [!NOTE]
>
> `yarn` should be installed via Corepack ([tutorial](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack))\_

> [!NOTE]
>
> To make any asset available to a local code interpreter place them the following directory: ./examples/tmp/local\_

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker distribution with support for compose is required, the following are supported:
>
> - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
> - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) - macOS users may want to use VZ instead of QEMU
> - [Podman](https://podman.io/) - requires [compose](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose) and **rootful machine** (if your current machine is rootless, please create a new one)

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework`.
2. Install dependencies `yarn install`.
3. Create `.env` (from `.env.template`) and fill in missing values (if any).
4. Start the code interpreter `yarn run infra:start-code-interpreter`.
5. Start the agent `yarn run start:bee` (it runs ./examples/agents/bee.ts file).
