<h1 align="center">BeeAI Framework</h1>

BeeAI Framework is an open-source library for building **production-ready multi-agent systems**.<br>
The framework is available both as a [Python](/python/docs) and [TypeScript](/typescript/docs) library. 
We are committed to maintaining parity between the two.

## Latest updates

- üöÄ **2025-02-19**: Launched an alpha of the Python library and rebranded to BeeAI Framework. See our [getting started guide](/python/docs).
- üöÄ **2025-02-07**: Introduced [Backend](/typescript/docs/backend.md) module to simplify working with AI services (chat, embedding). See our [migration guide](/typescript/docs/migration_guide.md).
- üß† **2025-01-28**: Added support for [DeepSeek R1](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120), check out the [Competitive Analysis Workflow example](/typescript/examples/workflows/competitive-analysis)
- üöÄ **2025-01-09**:
  - Introduced [Workflows](/typescript/docs/workflows.md), a way of building multi-agent systems.
  - Added support for [Model Context Protocol](https://i-am-bee.github.io/bee-agent-framework/#/tools?id=using-the-mcptool-class), featured on the [official page](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#bee-agent-framework).
- üöÄ **2024-12-09**: Added support for [LLaMa 3.3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct).
- üöÄ **2024-11-21**: Added an experimental [Streamlit agent](typescript/examples/agents/experimental/streamlit.ts).

For a full changelog, see our [releases page](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/releases).

## Why pick BeeAI?

**üèÜ Build the optimal agent architecture for your use case.** To design the right architecture for your use case, you need flexibility in both orchestrating agents and defining their roles and behaviors. With the BeeAI framework, you can implement any multi-agent pattern using Workflows. Start with our out-of-the-box ReActAgent, or easily customize your own agent implementation.

**üöÄ Scale effortlessly with production-grade controls.** Deploying multi-agent systems requires efficient resource management and reliability. With the BeeAI framework, you can optimize token usage through [memory strategies](/typescript/docs/memory.md), persist and restore agent state via  [(de)serialization](/typescript/docs/serialization.md), generate [structured outputs](typescript/examples/backend/structured.ts), and execute generated code in a sandboxed environment. When things go wrong, BeeAI helps you track the full agent workflow through [events](/typescript/docs/emitter.md), collect [telemetry](/typescript/docs/instrumentation.md), log diagnostic data, and handle errors with clear, well-defined [exceptions](/typescript/docs/errors.md).

**üîå Seamlessly integrate with your models and tools.** Get started with any model from Ollama, Groq, OpenAI, watsonx.ai, and [more](/typescript/docs/backend.md). Leverage tools from LangChain, connect to any server using the Model Context Protocol, or build your own custom tools. BeeAI is designed for extensibility, allowing you to integrate with the systems and capabilities you need.

## Installation

To install the Python library:
```shell
pip install beeai-framework
```

To install the TypeScript library:
```shell
npm install beeai-framework
```

For more guidance and starter examples in your desired language, head to the docs pages for [Python](/python/docs) and [TypeScript](/typescript/docs).

## Quick example

This example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent workflow using BeeAI Framework in TypeScript:

<!-- embedme typescript/examples/workflows/multiAgentsSimple.ts -->

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { UnconstrainedMemory } from "bee-agent-framework/memory/unconstrainedMemory";
import { OpenMeteoTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/weather/openMeteo";
import { WikipediaTool } from "bee-agent-framework/tools/search/wikipedia";
import { AgentWorkflow } from "bee-agent-framework/experimental/workflows/agent";
import { Message, Role } from "bee-agent-framework/llms/primitives/message";
import { GroqChatLLM } from "bee-agent-framework/adapters/groq/chat";

const workflow = new AgentWorkflow();

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Researcher",
  instructions: "You are a researcher assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new WikipediaTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "WeatherForecaster",
  instructions: "You are a weather assistant. Respond only if you can provide a useful answer.",
  tools: [new OpenMeteoTool()],
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
  execution: { maxIterations: 3 },
});

workflow.addAgent({
  name: "Solver",
  instructions:
    "Your task is to provide the most useful final answer based on the assistants' responses which all are relevant. Ignore those where assistant do not know.",
  llm: new GroqChatLLM(),
});

const memory = new UnconstrainedMemory();

await memory.add(
  Message.of({
    role: Role.USER,
    text: "What is the capital of France and what is the current weather there?",
    meta: { createdAt: new Date() },
  }),
);

const { result } = await workflow.run(memory.messages).observe((emitter) => {
  emitter.on("success", (data) => {
    console.log(`-> ${data.step}`, data.response?.update?.finalAnswer ?? "-");
  });
});

console.log(`Agent ü§ñ`, result.finalAnswer);
```
Python version of this example coming soon.

## Roadmap

- Python parity with Typescript
- Standalone docs site
- Integration with watsonx.ai for deployment
- More multi-agent reference architecture implementations using workflows
- More OTTB agent implementations
- Native tool calling with supported LLM providers
